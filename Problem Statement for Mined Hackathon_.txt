Problem Statement


Your task is to create a conversational AI model using Google Dialogflow that can understand natural language queries for diamonds and generate filtering parameters for a large inventory of diamond data. The diamond data consists of more than 100,000 rows and includes various attributes such as shape, size, weight, clarity, color, and cut.


The model should be able to understand a wide range of natural language queries, including those with common typing errors, short forms, and specific shortcuts used in the diamond industry. The queries can include parameters such as shape, size, weight, clarity, color, and cut, and the model should be able to interpret these parameters even when they are expressed in ranges or with variations in wording.

Once the model understands the query, it should generate filtering parameters that can be used to search the diamond inventory and return matching results. The filtering parameters can include a combination of various attributes such as shape, size, weight, clarity, color, and cut, and should be optimized for accuracy and efficiency.


A diamond can have many properties like REPORTNO, SHAPE, WEIGHT, CUT, POLISH, etc. You can read about these properties and characteristics in detail at: https://diamondbuzz.blog/diamond-properties-and-characteristics/.


To accomplish this task, you will need to use Google Dialogflow to build a conversational AI model that can understand natural language queries and generate filtering parameters. You will also need to work with the diamond inventory data and use data processing and analysis techniques to optimize the filtering parameters and improve the accuracy of the model.


In the given dataset, each column represents a property of a diamond, and each row is an individual diamond.


Dataset Description:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LCqzDfJQMhy82R0yYPhWbq8_Szua8XTf?usp=sharing


NOTES:
* We will look for a range of filters and the robustness of the application. 
* We are not looking for any frontend. It should be API based or should be easily integrated into Google Co-lab.
* This will be an NLP project but using Google Dialogflow.
* Dialogflow, in this case, should understand diamond related properties and language.




Prizes:
The top three teams will receive cash prizes as follows:
1st place: Rs. 15,000
2nd place: Rs. 10,000
3rd place: Rs. 5,000
In addition, there will be three consolation prizes of Rs. 1,000 each.


Good luck, and happy hacking!








Examples : 


User Input:
* data containing reportno, shape, per, total for diamonds of shape round, oval, and heart


Output:
* Dialogflow should generate the following filter:
Columns = [reportno, shape, per, total]
        Shape = [round, oval, heart]


User Input:
*  I am looking for vvs diamond of g to i color of size around 1 carat


Output:
* Dialogflow should generate the following filter:
Columns = [(all columns)]
        Weight = [0.85 - 1.15]
Color = [g, h, i]
Clarity = [vvs]
